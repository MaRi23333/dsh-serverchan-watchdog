# Releasing

Normal releases are published to npm automatically by
`.github/workflows/publish.yml` when a non-prerelease GitHub Release is
**published**. The workflow uses npm OIDC Trusted Publishing; it does not use an
npm token or GitHub repository secret.

`v0.1.1` was the one-time interactive bootstrap release. Do not create a GitHub
Release for that already-published version after this workflow is installed: the
workflow will correctly reject it because `dsh-serverchan-watchdog@0.1.1`
already exists.

## One-time Trusted Publisher setup

After `publish.yml` exists on the public repository's default branch and the npm
package has been bootstrapped, prefer npm's CLI over manually copying fields into
the website:

```powershell
npm whoami --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
npm trust github dsh-serverchan-watchdog --repo MaRi23333/dsh-serverchan-watchdog --file publish.yml --allow-publish --dry-run --json --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
npm trust github dsh-serverchan-watchdog --repo MaRi23333/dsh-serverchan-watchdog --file publish.yml --allow-publish --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

The dry run must identify this package, `MaRi23333/dsh-serverchan-watchdog`,
`publish.yml`, and publish permission only. The package uses no GitHub Actions
environment and does not grant staged-publish permission. Run the non-dry-run
command in the npm owner's interactive terminal and complete browser 2FA there;
never copy an OTP, temporary auth URL, or npm token into an agent conversation.

The owner can inspect the saved relationship with:

```powershell
npm trust list dsh-serverchan-watchdog --json --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

npm may require another browser 2FA flow even for `trust list`. The first
end-to-end proof will be the next real Release-driven npm version and its
registry provenance.

## 1. Prepare and verify the version

Update `package.json`, version-bearing source constants, and committed build
artifacts together. Then run:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run test
pnpm run build
git diff --exit-code -- lib
pnpm run check:smoke
pnpm run check:pack
```

Review the package contents and confirm that the repository working tree is
clean after committing the release candidate.

## 2. Create the immutable tag

Create an **annotated** tag whose name is exactly `v${version}`:

```sh
git tag -a v0.1.2 -m "dsh-serverchan-watchdog v0.1.2"
git push origin main
git push origin v0.1.2
```

Do not use a lightweight tag and never move an existing published tag. The
workflow verifies that the Release tag is annotated, points to the checked-out
commit, and exactly matches the version in `package.json`.

Wait for both the `main` and tag CI runs to pass before continuing.

## 3. Publish the GitHub Release

Create and publish a normal GitHub Release from the new annotated tag. The
`publish-npm` workflow then performs frozen installation, typecheck, tests,
build, committed-`lib` verification, smoke, package whitelist, and `npm publish`
through OIDC. Successful public OIDC publishes carry npm/SLSA provenance.

## 4. Do not publish manually

Do not run `npm publish` for a normal release. A manual publish can race the
workflow or permanently consume the version without provenance. After the
workflow succeeds, verify `latest`, repository metadata, provenance, the
registry tarball, and an isolated DSH-profile install.
